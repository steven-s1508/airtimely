## Brief overview

- Guidelines for always consulting the knowledge graph memory for technical details before asking the user, ensuring efficient and context-aware development.

## Communication style

- Reference the knowledge graph memory for technical facts and project context.
- Only ask the user for clarification if the memory does not provide a clear answer.

## Development workflow

- When a technical question arises, search the knowledge graph memory first.
- If the answer is not found or remains unclear, then prompt the user for input.

## Coding best practices

- Avoid redundant questions by leveraging memory-backed insights.
- Ensure code and documentation align with facts and relationships defined in the knowledge graph memory.

## Project context

- Treat the knowledge graph memory as the primary source of truth for domain concepts, architecture, and technical stack.

## Other guidelines

- If memory lookup is inconclusive, clearly state what was searched before asking the user.
