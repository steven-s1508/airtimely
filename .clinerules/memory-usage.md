## Brief overview

- Guidelines for leveraging the knowledge graph memory within this project workspace to enhance development, context-awareness, and code quality.

## Communication style

- Reference the knowledge graph memory when discussing entities, relationships, or project context.
- Use concise language when referring to memory-backed facts or relationships.

## Development workflow

- Consult the knowledge graph memory for project-specific entities, data models, and their relationships before implementing new features or refactoring.
- When adding new domain concepts or significant logic, consider updating the knowledge graph memory to reflect these changes.

## Coding best practices

- Align code structure and naming with entities and relationships defined in the knowledge graph memory.
- Use memory-backed insights to avoid duplication and ensure consistency across modules.

## Project context

- Treat the knowledge graph memory as a source of truth for domain modeling and architectural decisions within this workspace.
- When in doubt about a domain concept, check the memory before proceeding.

## Other guidelines

- Do not hardcode domain relationships that are already represented in the knowledge graph memory.
- Prefer querying or referencing the memory for cross-cutting concerns and shared logic.
- If a new feature, function, or other significant element is added, check the knowledge graph memory for its existence and create a new entry if missing.
- If an existing entry has changed in a meaningful way, update the knowledge graph memory to reflect the changes.
