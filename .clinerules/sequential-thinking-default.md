## Brief overview

- Guidelines for always leveraging the sequential thinking MCP server when tasked with creating new features or providing explanations.
- These rules are project-wide and apply to all development and explanation tasks.

## Communication style

- When asked to explain a concept or process, use the sequential thinking MCP server to structure the explanation step-by-step.
- Responses should reflect the output of the sequential thinking tool, ensuring clarity and logical progression.

## Development workflow

- For any new feature request or architectural design, initiate the process using the sequential thinking MCP server to break down the problem into manageable steps.
- Use the tool to guide planning, design, and implementation phases, revising steps as needed.

## Coding best practices

- Ensure that code and documentation produced as a result of sequential thinking outputs are clear, modular, and follow the logical steps generated by the tool.
- Revisit and refine steps using the MCP server if requirements change or clarification is needed.

## Project context

- Treat the sequential thinking MCP server as the default approach for problem-solving and explanation within this project.

## Other guidelines

- Do not bypass the sequential thinking MCP server for tasks involving new features or explanations, unless explicitly instructed otherwise.
