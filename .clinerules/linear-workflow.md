## Brief overview

- Guidelines for managing complex, multi-step features using Linear issues in the Airtimely workspace.
- These rules are project-specific for Airtimely.

## Communication style

- Propose breaking down complex features into smaller, actionable steps.
- Clearly communicate the breakdown and the plan for issue creation.
- Always ask which project to assign new issues to before creation.
- Clearly communicate the status, labels, and assignee for each issue.

## Development workflow

- For any complex or multi-step feature, suggest a workflow split into discrete tasks.
- Create a Linear issue for each step in the Airtimely workspace.
- Reference related issues for traceability.
- Assign the user as the assignee for every new Linear issue.
- Set the status to "Todo" if the issue is for current work, or "Backlog" for future releases.
- Always apply appropriate labels to each issue.
- Confirm the correct project assignment with the user before creating issues.

## Coding best practices

- Ensure each Linear issue is focused, actionable, and scoped to a single step or concern.
- Use descriptive titles and concise descriptions for each issue.

## Project context

- Always use the Airtimely workspace (team) for all Linear issue creation and tracking.

## Other guidelines

- Avoid bundling unrelated changes into a single issue.
- Use this workflow for both new features and significant refactors.
- Maintain consistency in assignee, status, labels, and project assignment for all issues.
