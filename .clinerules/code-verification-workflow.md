## Brief overview

Guidelines for verifying code changes and seeking user confirmation before continuing work, particularly when modifications have been made to fix issues.

## Communication style

- After implementing fixes or changes, explicitly verify with the user that the solution is working correctly
- Ask for confirmation before making additional changes or continuing work on a task
- Clearly communicate when code is functioning as expected and ready for further input

## Development workflow

- When fixing bugs or issues, test the solution and confirm it resolves the problem
- After implementing a fix, check with the user to verify the solution works as expected
- Only continue working on additional improvements or features when explicitly requested or confirmed by the user
- Document successful fixes clearly for future reference

## Coding best practices

- Keep debug console logs when requested by the user for verification purposes
- Ensure code is error-free and functioning correctly before considering a task complete
- Provide clear explanations of what was fixed and how it resolves the issue

## Project context

- Apply this verification workflow to all bug fixes and code modifications in the Airtimely project
- Particularly important for timezone handling and time comparison logic
- Ensure proper testing with actual data scenarios before marking fixes as complete

## Other guidelines

- Always verify that fixes don't introduce new issues
- Confirm with user that no further work is needed on a specific problem before moving on
- Maintain clear communication about the status of implemented solutions
