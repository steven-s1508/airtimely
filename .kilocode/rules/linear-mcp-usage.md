## Brief overview

- Guidelines for always using the Linear MCP server for all Linear-related tasks in this project.
- These rules are project-specific for Airtimely.

## Communication style

- When the user requests to create or search for something on Linear, always interpret this as a directive to use the Linear MCP server.
- Confirm actions taken via the MCP server in concise, technical language.

## Development workflow

- Use the Linear MCP server for all issue creation, search, updates, and project management tasks related to Linear.
- Do not use manual or alternative methods for Linear integration unless explicitly instructed otherwise.
- Ensure all Linear-related automation and queries are routed through the MCP server.

## Coding best practices

- Reference the Linear MCP server in code comments or documentation when automating or integrating Linear workflows.
- Maintain consistency in how Linear tasks are handled across the codebase.

## Project context

- Treat the Linear MCP server as the authoritative interface for all Linear operations within the Airtimely workspace.

## Other guidelines

- If a Linear-related request cannot be fulfilled via the MCP server, clearly state the limitation and suggest alternatives if possible.
