## Real-time ride tracking for theme park enthusiasts — powered by the community

Airtimely is a theme park companion app that provides live wait times and park opening hours across parks worldwide. Built with thrill seekers in mind, Airtimely helps you plan your day smarter and ride more — whether you're chasing airtime, credits, or just avoiding the longest queues.

This app is proudly built on top of the incredible open data provided by [api.waitingtimes.app](https://api.waitingtimes.app), which aggregates live queue times from dozens of theme parks around the world. Huge thanks to the developers and community behind that project — this app wouldn’t be possible without your work. 🙌
